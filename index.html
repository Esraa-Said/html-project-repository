Artificial Intelligence is wide-ranging branch of computer science which deals with 
building smart machines have the ability to perform tasks which require human intelligence.</br>
Artificial intelligence is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches,</br> but advantages in machine learning and 
deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the technology industry.</br>
AI has two categories:</br>
1) Narrow AI (weak AI):this kind of artificial intelligence is focused on performing a single task.</br> 
These mashines may seem intelligent but they are operating under far more constrains and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.</br>
2) General AI (Strong AI): we can see this type in the movies like robots, and it can apply the intelligence to solve any problem.

<h2>Advantages of AI:</h2>
(1) Less Routine: Machines surpass humanity in meticulous tasks with routine tasks automated, so the robots can assume work related to analyses, subtle dudgments and problem-solving.</br>
Using artificial intelligence at work, will decrease the workload and humans can improve their skills and employees will focus on the creative aspects of their jops.</br>
(2) No Brakes: People need to relax from time to time, but machines do not get tired or distracted or bored, so they can work 24*7 and have higher capacity.</br>
(3) No Human Errors: AI computers are error-free.</br>
Industries can benefit from these computers where Eliminating costly errors leads these businesses to higher output.</br>
(4) Less Risk: Artificial Intelligence saves the life of human and reduces the risk to human well-being and safety.</br>
AI can also predict wildfire thearts and fight it with the help of drones.</br>
<h2>Disadvantages of AI:</h2>
(1) Cost: AI is very expensive, It's clear when we combine the cost of installation, maintenance and repair.</br>
(2) Lack of personal connections: Smart machines can improve the education experience, but they shouldn't be considered a suitable for personal interaction.</br>
Relying on these machines to grade or tutor may lead to educational oversight which hurt learners more than help.</br>
(3) Efficient Decision making: Computers are getting smarter everyday, they are demonstrating not only an ability to learn, but to teach other computers.</br>
It is debatable whether computers can implement intuition- based decision making in new situations, which often arises in the classroom.</br>
(4) Addiction: If we use machines everyday to do tasks, we risk technology addiction.
